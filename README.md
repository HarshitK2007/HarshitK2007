Hi, I’m Harshit Kumar.
I’m interested in programming simply.
I’m currently learning python libraries (fastapi, tkinter, Ctkinter, request), you can pretty much guess, what am I trying to cook.
I’m looking to collaborate on anything, yup anything cuz my curiosity has no bounds but of the languages... I prefer Python, C, CPP, C#, HTML, CSS ,JS.
How to reach me? I dont think you will ever need to reach me, cuz I will always be there.
Pronouns: He/Him
Fun fact: One day, I saw a short of Vinta Chen (the best at github accoring to that short), so I joined it the same day.
