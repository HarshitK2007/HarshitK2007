# If you have any suggestion for me, then please be my guest.

# I am still learning Github. It's surely harder than HTML so I need time, to make it look professional, anyways.

## About me
Hi, I’m <b>@HarshitK2007</b>.
<br>
The story behind this weird username is simple, My name is <b>Harshit Kumar</b> and I was born in <b>2007</b>, the rest is easy to figure out.

## My interest
<br>
I’m interested in programming simply and I love to deep dive into topics.

## Am i busy?
I’m currently learning <b>python libraries</b> (fastapi, tkinter, Ctkinter, request), you can pretty much guess, what am I trying to cook.

## Call me when you want, call me when you need
I’m looking to collaborate on anything, yup anything cuz my curiosity has no bounds but within languages... I prefer <b><i>Python</i>, C, CPP, C#, HTML, CSS ,JS</b>.

## Wanna talk?
How to reach me? I dont think you will ever need to reach me, cuz <b>I will always be there</b>.
<br>
Nah, <b>Feel free to reach out</b> (though I barely use any social media so Github is your answer), after all who doesn't want to collaborate here.
<br>
<b>Check out my repositories</b> to see what I'm working on.

## Blah Blah 
Pronouns: <b>He/Him</b>
<br>
Fun fact: One day, I saw a short of <a href = "https://github.com/vinta"><b><i>Vinta Chen</i></b></a> (the best at github according to that short), so I joined it the same day.
